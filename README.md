Project Description:
To use a combination of machine learning and python programming to develop a game of rock, paper, scissors.
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.

The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.

This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.
